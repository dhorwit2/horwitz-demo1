clothing_01_oregon_1870,Dress and belt with awl case,"Wasco, Native American.",1870,"Plateau cultures thrived in the hilly steppe region between the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and the Rockies in Idaho and Montana. Garments of superior craftsmanship incorporating trade goods, such as this example, expressed personal identity and a family’s high status. The woman who made this two-hide dress lavishly covered the torso and sleeves with black-and-white beadwork, which she framed with fringes embellished with glass beads, cowry shells, bone, and two highly prized elk canines. The dress is accompanied by its own belt and awl case: awls were among the tools that women used in the preparation of animal skins.",Dresses,Oregon; Washington,,,The Metropolitan Museum of Art,,,,,,https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,,,,,,
sculpture_03_unknown_unknown,Pendant with figure,Unknown,1200,"This is the largest and most elaborately carved standing figure from an understudied culture that flourished in the Pacific Northwest during the first millenium. Its author depicted prominent knees, elbows, and splayed feet as well as a skirt or loincloth, similar to later rbaided grass skirts from the reigon. The figure wears a large headdress--which resembles later known headdresses with earflaps--adorned with alternating bands of sunbursts and triangles and fields of vertical incisions. Although the fiure's function is unknown, the intractate headdress and body marking suggest that it oculd be the portrait of a specific individual.",Wood Carvings,Oregon or Washington,,,The Metropolitan Museum of Art,,,,,,https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,,,,,,
